    <div class="about-body">
        <p>I am an aspiring maker, interested in creating products that intersect design and functionality, both in the virtual and physical world. These projects can range anywhere from a Chrome extension to a physical word clock.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, you may find me folding some modular origami or playing all types of games; I particularly enjoy Settlers of Catan and Super Smash Bros. right now. I also am an amateur foodie, and have a weakness for dark chocolate and coconut water.</p>
        <p>In a past life, I was a water polo player and crossfitter. I still like to keep up-to-date with both activities, though.</p>
