Personal Website
================

This is my updated personal website, now built using Backbone and Require.js.
You can see the live version [here](http://jonlai.com/).

To run a local copy, `cd` to this directory and run:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
This instantiates a local server for the directory. You can then view my site at
the `localhost` port provided.
